# Starter kit for ML using the Kaggle Titanic dataset

Objective is to predict which passengers survived the Titanic disaster, using the [Kaggle Titanic dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic)

## Notes

* Contents here are mostly from [Manav Sehgal's fantastic tutorial](https://www.kaggle.com/startupsci/titanic-data-science-solutions) which contains examples of several useful functions from the [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org) and [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org) libraries


* The [ML_models library](./ML_models.py) contains implementations of several traditional ML models (e.g., KNN, SVM, Naive Bayes) that can be rapidly employed for other problems
